The goal of labelr is to simplify the process of creating training datasets for image classification.
It was created at Brainhack in Montreal by the Deep Neuron team.

By default, the 3 ways an image can be classed is "Pyramidal" "Regular" and "Unknown". These choices can be changed by editing `views/classify.html`.
